        <h3 class="alt-h3 mb-1">Straight forward</h3>
        <p class="mb-3 mb-md-5"> Email encryption with just a few clicks. Never again you have to create a PGP Key with an external website or service. The Keystore will also automatically use available keys to sign and encrypt your emails.</p>
        <h3 class="alt-h3 mb-1">Minimalistic</h3>
        <p class="mb-3 mb-md-5"> With simplicity in mind we created a very basic and userfriend GUI. The user should not worry about functions and settings. Our thoughts about the userinterface were: "The simpler the better". For advanced settings a special tab will be available within the next few master updates.</p>
        <h3 class="alt-h3 mb-1">Customizable</h3>
        <p class="mb-3 mb-md-4"> Are you a java developer? Simply go to github and fork our repository. You are free to redistribute and share the project as long as you do this under the Terms of Service. A license is shipped with. All the work is under MIT license.</p>
