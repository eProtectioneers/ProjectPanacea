## Troubleshooting

#### Important notice
Project Panacea is currently not able to work with the IMAP protocol. That's why we are using POP and SMPT for the moment. To use Project Panacea with your Gmail account, you need to activate the "allow less secure apps" option inside your Google settings tab. Visit this article to see how: Google Support. If you still have problems receiving emails, feel free to contact us or visit the issue page on Github.
