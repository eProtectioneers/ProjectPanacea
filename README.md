A secure and futuristic email client coded in java! Enhance your security with eProtectioneers software solutions!

## What is Project Panacea?
Project Panacea is a safe, minimalistic and open source email client from the eProtectioneers Team. Project Panacea has been created with simplicity and safety in mind. Therefore we focused on a minimalistic user interface and simple functions. You won't have to worry about settings and other time-consuming things.

## Troubleshooting

#### Important notice
Project Panacea is currently not able to work with the IMAP protocol. That's why we are using POP and SMPT for the moment. To use Project Panacea with your Gmail account, you need to activate the "allow less secure apps" option inside your Google settings tab. Visit this article to see how: Google Support. If you still have problems receiving emails, feel free to contact us or visit the issue page on GitHub.

#### Support after release
By providing continuous support for our application we want to ensure a maximum in security. Stay always up to date with the weekly patches and feature improvements. For more information about feature updates and roadmaps visit eprotectioneers.netAI.net!
